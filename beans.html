Did you know that Mrs. Bean is <b>not</b> the sweet old lady she is often rumored to be?

Yes!

It's true!

She was once a lady of the night! That's right! One time she was out past 10 o'clock, bringing Mr. Bean his supper in the barn. And she was so embarrassed about having to go outside so late she called herself a lady of the night as punishment.
